# DISTRIBUTION IN BIOMES
Scripts on the analyses on the geographic distributions of extant mammals among different biomes in the Americas

Distribution data is from the [WildFinder Database](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/wildfinder-database) which is based on the WWF global ecoregions [Olson et al. 2001](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/11/933/227116) and it uses the [Wilson and Reeder (2005)](https://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/preface.html) taxonomy.

When necesary, the taxonomy was updated following [VertLife Mammal taxonomy]( https://data.vertlife.org/mammaltree/taxonomy_mamPhy_5911species.csv) and the [ASM mammal diversity database](https://www.mammaldiversity.org/index.html).

After a manual revision of the ocurrences in Paramos Ecoregions, we excluded 23 occurrences of species whose upper elevational limit is below 2000 meters according to the [IUCN red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)
